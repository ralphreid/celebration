        <p class="imp">To add the RSVP form on a page, use the [rsvp] shortcode.</p>
        <p>To send email invitations and check who completed RSVP go to <strong>Plugins > RSVP</strong>.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/05.png" style="max-width: 140px;"/>
        <p>The guest list will be empty. To add a guest, click "Add guest" button.</p>
        <p>This is how a table with added guests will look &darr;</p>
        <img src="assets/images/06.png" style="width: 98%; max-width: 1142px;"/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Statistics:</strong> On top of the page, you will see some statistics:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Confirmed menus</strong> (Total/Kids/Vegetarian) which is the sum of each type of menus required by each guest that RSVPed Yes.<br/>
                        <strong>Total</strong> is the total number of persons that will be attending, including kids/vegetarians<br/>
                        <span style="font-style: italic;">Example</span>: One guest RSVPed with total menus 4, kids 2 and vegetarian 1, this means that they will need 4 menus: 2 kids menus, 1 vegetarian menu and 1 standard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Responses</strong> (Yes/No/Pending) which is the number of people that RSVPed Yes/No and the number of people that did not respond yet.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To add a guest</strong>, click "Add guest" button, fill in the fields (all fields but the number of menus are required) and click Save.</li>
            <li><strong>To edit a guest's information</strong>, click on his/hers name.<br>
                <img src="assets/images/07.png"/><br/>
                The edit form will appear. Fill in the fields (all fields but the number of menus are required) and click Save.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>To delete one or multiple guests</strong>, check the boxes before each person you want to delete, and select "Delete" from the "Bulk Actions" drop down menu. Then click Apply. You will be asked to confirm this action before it is completed.<br/>
                <img src="assets/images/08.png" style="max-width: 400px;"/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To order guests alphabetically by name or by any other column entry</strong>, click the up/down arrows next to the respective column.<br/>
                <img src="assets/images/09.png" style="max-width: 350px;"/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>If you prefer not to have to add your guests in the guest list:</strong> By default the rsvp form validates the email of the person who rsvp's. If a person who rsvp's is not on your guest list, he/she will not be able to complete the rsvp and will be notified that he/she is not on the guest list. If you prefer not to have to add your guests in the guest list, click "Click to disable" link.
                With validation disabled, anybody can rsvp without being previously added to the guest list. Those who rsvp will be displayed just the same in the guest list table. Also, when validation is disabled, a captcha will show in the rsvp form, to prevent spam.<br/>
                <img src="assets/images/10.png" style="max-width: 400px;"/>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To send wedding invitations</strong>, check the boxes before each person you want to invite,
                and select "Send invitation" from the "Bulk Actions" drop down menu. Then click Apply. You will be asked to confirm this action before you continue.<br/>
                <img src="assets/images/08.png" style="max-width: 400px;"/>
                <br/>
                Then you will be prompted to add the invitation text (which will appear on the wedding invitation email).
                <br/>
                <img src="assets/images/11.png" style="max-width: 600px;"/>
                <br/>
                The RSVP link text is the text that will appear on the RSVP button underneath the invitation text in the email. <strong>(see the preview bellow)</strong><br/>
                When the person invited will click on this button it will open the link specified as RSVP link. This should be the link to the RSVP page you created.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p>You can preview the email before sending by clicking the <strong>Preview invite</strong> button or send the invitation email by clicking <strong>Send invites</strong>.<br/>
                The wedding invitation will look like this:</p>
                <p class="imp">Please note that "Receiver's name here" is automatically replaced with the recipient's name, and that the "Please RSVP online here" button will have the text and link you provided.</p>
                <img src="assets/images/12.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RSVP Page:</strong> When the invited guests open the link in the email, they will see the RSVP form. <strong>(see Installing Step 3.)</strong><br/>
                This form will required them to enter their <strong>First/Last Name</strong>, <strong>Phone number</strong>, <strong>Email address</strong> and
                choose between <strong>"I Will Attend"</strong> and <strong>"Sorry, I will no be able to attend"</strong>.<br/>
                If they choose <strong>"I Will Attend"</strong>, they are prompted to fill in the <strong>Number of Persons attending</strong> (which is required),
                and the <strong>Number of Kids menus</strong> and <strong>Number of Vegetarian menus</strong> (if needed).<br/>
                Then they can click <strong>"Complete RSVP"</strong> to send their RSPV.
                <br/><br/>
                They will only be able to RSVP if the email address they submit matches the one you added in the Admin page. (this is the email where they received their invite)
                <br/>
                You can check the WP Admin page on your site to see the RSVP status for each guest and general statistics.
